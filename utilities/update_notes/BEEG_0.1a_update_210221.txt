So I pushed the big update to the BEEG update. All the changes I've worked on over the last several weeks.

The first 6 levels of Sacred Stones have been playtested, to some extent, and 95% of the content is available.
This was a big effort in terms of content!

*What has changed?*
- Many Many Bug fixes, especially with AI, Combat calculations, the Prep Screen, Events, and Saving/Loading games
- Many minor internal optimazations to the engine, which you won't notice but should make adding additional code later on much smoother
- Promotion
- Echoes-style promotion bonuses
- Lateral Class Change
- Stat Boosting Items
- Fog of War
- Lion Throne style Line of Sight
- Combination of Fog of War and Line of Sight
- AI Fog of War
- Steal AI
- Invertable Unit Spec AI (Attack all EXCEPT unit)
- Records System (keeps track of many different statistics)
- Lore System
- Can copy and paste data objects in the GUI
- Portrait Editor now auto-matches correct offsets
- Panoramas now distinguish between loading a movie vs a static image
- Extras menu in Title Screen (All Saves and Options/Settings available for now)
- Can now save the game from within an event! (this was a nightmare to code)
- Units in the players party will automatically appear on formation tiles when the prep screen is called
- The GUI will automatically save your game when you begin a playtest
- Change text color in dialogs between black, white, and red (for now)
- {eval:2+2} and {var:tactician} now work in dialogs

New Event Commands
 - Reset (refreshes a unit)
 - MultiAddPortrait (qol addition to add multiple portraits to the screen at once)
 - MultiRemovePortrait (qol addition to remove multiple portraits from the screen at once)
 - RemoveAllUnits
 - RemoveItem
 - CenterCursor
 - ChangeStats (allows on-the-fly changing of unit's stats)
 - SetStats (same thing, but hard set instead of offset)
 - AutoLevelTo (auto level a unit to a certain level)
 - MapAnim (show an animation on the map)
 - TriggerScript (call another event from within this event)
 - ChangeTilemap
 - LoadUnit (loads a unit to the level even if not normally loaded in)
 - MakeGeneric (makes a generic unit and adds it to the level)

I was still finding bugs/isses even today while playtesting, so there are assuredly more out there.
