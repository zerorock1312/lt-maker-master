sequence items need a paradigm shift

Game needs to be able to tell whether it can use the item and its targeting before even the first targeting (for things like rescue having a legal traversable spot in adjacent spaces) X

Basic Weapon X
Basic Spell X
Wyrmsblast
Searing Daggers X
Searing Daggers that does not allow the same target X
MultiAttack Searing Daggers that can hit the same enemy multiple times X
Warp X
Rescue X
AOE attack that also refreshes the user X

For warp and rescue, could switch sequence item to multi-target item
Takes in list of items and runs the targeting on each of them
Applies all targeting

One combat, list of main targets, list of splash
Runs solver in parallel on each of the items

So for Rescue, solver takes in the list of items and a list of main targets and a list of splash
Then does each on_hit immediately and in order
