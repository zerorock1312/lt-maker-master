# Questions to Answer
# How do item mods work -- Critical, Brave Strike, Longshot, Cleave
# Maybe item mods on init add a new item component to the items they care about
# so on activation of Cleave combat art, new Cleave item component is applied to items that fit rules 
# How do proc effects work
# How do combat arts work
# How do activated items work -- create new ability with one item that can be used
