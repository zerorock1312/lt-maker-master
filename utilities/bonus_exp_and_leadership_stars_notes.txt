# Potential Improvements to Bonus Experience
Support for defining a custom equation
Make the state transparent so we get to see some movement (basically, allow it to still show the select menu)
Make exp increment not an int, so we can support bonus exp -> level of less than 100

# Potential Improvements to Leadership Stars
Genealogy style leadership stars (Bonus only when within X tiles)
Should units get the benefits of their own stars? (they do currently)
Consider supporting lead_damage, lead_resist, lead_crit, lead_dodge, lead_attackspeed, lead_defensespeed
