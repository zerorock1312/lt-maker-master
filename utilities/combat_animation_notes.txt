A Combat Pose is a series of commands which operate on a set of frames
Example poses: Stand, Dodge, Attack, Miss, Critical, (Custom Pose)

A WeaponSet is a collection of poses, generally for the same weapon
    A WeaponSet always has the same set of defined poses, but additional ones can be added
 - CombatAnimation defines when it should be used
 - Sword WeaponSet should be used when wielding a non-Magic Sword
 - MagicSword WeaponSet should be used when wielding a Magic Sword
 - Axe WeaponSet should be used when wielding a non-Ranged Axe
 - RangedAxe WeaponSet should be used when wielding a Ranged Sword
 - So dropdown with collection of weapon types
 - Plus dropdown for ('Normal', 'Ranged', 'Magic')

A CombatAnimation is a collection of WeaponSets. A CombatAnimation also has a set of available Palettes. If a Palette matches the name of a unit, they will use that Palette. Otherwise, they will use a generic palette appropriate for their team

Classes have an assigned CombatAnimation
