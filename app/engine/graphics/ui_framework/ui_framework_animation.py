    Usage of this is straightforward. An animation consists of the following:
    
        component [UIComponent]: A UI Component on which to perform the animation.
        
        halt_condition [Callable[[UIComponent, Optional[int]], bool]]:
            A function (or list of such functions) 
            that takes in a UI component and time passed and informs us if the 
            animation is finished. Defaults to None, which means that it will run before_anim 
            function once, and end immediately.
        
        before_anim, do_anim, after_anim [Callable[[UIComponent, Optional[int]]]]:
            A series of arbitrary functions (or list of such functions) 
            that take in a UI Component and time passed and 
            alter its properties in some way. Namely, these three functions will be called 
            on the provided UI Component above.
            
            before_anim is called once, when the animation is begun (via animation.begin())
            do_anim is continuously called.
            after_anim is called once, when the animation ends (via the halt_condition())
            
            Generally, it is advised that after_anim contains the expected end state of a
            component, as animations can be skipped, and do_anim is not guaranteed to be
            called until halt_condition is satisfied.
            
        skippable [bool]:
            Whether or not this animation is skippable. Some animations, such as passive hovering animations,
            are not skippable, and skipping them would result in a program lock.
